    "The frequency band for voice used in telephones is approximately 300 to 3400 Hz. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_frequency). To simulate this, take the FFT of the voice audio signal and apply a bandpass filter in the voice frequency range. That is, set the $Y[k] = w[k] X[k]$, where $w[k]$ is set to one for frequencies in the 300--3400 Hz range and set to zero elsewhere. **Note:** you will need to first calculate the conversion of the frequency parameter $k$ into Hz. Take the inverse FFT and listen to the resulting audio."

    "According to the same Wikipedia page, the fundamental frequency of a male speaking voice is between 85 to 155 Hz. Apply the same bandpass filter procedure as above, but with the frequency range of 85--310 Hz. (We have to double the upper limit of the frequency range to avoid aliasing. This is due to what is called the Nyquist-Shannon theorem, which we'll cover later in class!) Again, listen to the resulting audio. Is the speech still understandable when keeping only the fundamental frequencies, or were the harmonic overtones important contributions?"
