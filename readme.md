## Description

This course is an introduction to digital signal processing, which is
fundamental to modern data processing and analysis of audio, video, wireless
communications, and more. Topics include discrete-time signals and systems,
application of z-transforms, the discrete-time Fourier transform, sampling,
digital filter design, the discrete Fourier transform, the fast Fourier
transform, quantization effects, nonlinear filters, and machine learning of time
series data.

This class is intended for students interested in signals, data
analysis, or machine learning. Though not required, students might consider
first taking Machine Learning, Foundations of Data Analysis (CS 3501 / ECE
3502), or ECE Fundamentals III (which covers analog signals), depending on their
specific interests.
